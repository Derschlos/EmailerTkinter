# EmailerTkinter
A simple Tkinter app to prepare E-Mails from predefined texts and contacts

This was made mainly to learn a multiframe/object oriented Tkinter approach while reducing time spend preparing E-Mails at work.

Mail_versender is the main file and the start of the program. Here the base frame object is defined and the others are loaded.

SelectorPageData is the first page visible when starting the app. Files can be droped into the Listbox via drag an drop or deleted by doubleclick. 
Contacts are grouped by text.
Both can be edited via doubleclick or via buttons
TODO: (cosmetic) add Labels to communicate DnD and doubleclick functions to user.
